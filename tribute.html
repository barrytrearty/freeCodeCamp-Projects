        <h2 id="headline">A timeline of McNulty's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Creeslough, Co. Donegal. On the night of her birth, her father is arrested for IRA membership and would spend two years in prison.</li>
          <li><strong>1924</strong> - Following his release a year earlier, the family immigrates to Pennsylvania, USA.</li>
          <li><strong>1938</strong> - McNulty graduates from High School and wins a scholarship to Chestnut Hill College for Women having excelled in mathematics.</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Following a successful period in college, during which McNulty joined as many maths classes as were available, she is one of three women in her class to graduate with a Degree in Mathematics. In the same year, she secures a position in the U.S. Civil Service at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering. Her role involved the testing of ballistic missiles, a project which aimed to improve the US war effort. She is later moved to work on the differential analyser, which at the time was the sophisticated analogue mechanical calculator in the world. </li>
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - McNulty is selected, along with five other women, to work at Aberdeen military base in Maryland, developing the processor for a top-secret 30-ton machine called the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), the world's first general purpose computer.</li>
          <li><strong>1948</strong> - Her career slows somewhat following her marriage to ENIAC co-inventor John Mauchly, with whom she would have five children. She would continue to lend her programming abilities to her husband's projects, including the BINAC and UNIVAC I computers.</li>
          <li><strong>1980</strong> - McNulty is widowed when Mauchly passes away.</li>
          <li><strong>1985</strong> - McNulty marries again, this time to photographer, Savero Antonelli.</li>
          <li><strong>1997</strong> - Having been given little credit for her work and contributions for decades, McNulty, along with the other female programmers of the ENIAC project, are finally recognised and inducted into the <abbr title="Women in Technology International">WITI</abbr> Hall of Fame.</li>
          <li><strong>1999</strong> - Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Donegal names it's Computer Science scholarship after Kay.</li>
          <li><strong>2006</strong> - She is diagnosed with inoperable cancer and after a lifetime of contributions to the advancement of computer programming, Kathleen "Kay" McNulty Mauchly Antonelli sadly passes away.</li>
        </ul>
